# Quickly Adjust Colour Themes

This project came out of an idea I had as I starting working on a custom VS Code theme. Though I was making a primarily purple theme, it occurred to me that with the right tool, I could quickly modify the theme while retaining the "personality", viz. distinctions in contrast and relative hue. 

You can try it for yourself on [GitHub Pages](https://s-behrangi.github.io/colour-theme-transform/).

The tool works both for shifting hue:

And (with a little fiddling), flipping a theme from dark to light and vice versa:
